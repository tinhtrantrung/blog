## The truth about containers

Containers will not instantly turn our monolithic, legacy applications into distributed, scalable microservices.

Containers will not transform overnight all our software engineers into “DevOps engineers”.

```
DevOps is not defined by our tools or skills, but rather by a set of practices and cultural changes.
```

## What can containers do for us?

`Set up development environments in minutes` with just several commands. You can run a complex application
locally, on any machine where Docker installed (Linux, Windows, MacOS), in a few minutes. This helps onboarding
a new team member, or switching from a project to another, can now be quick and reliable. Cause each container
is perfectly isolated from the others and from the host system.

`Deploy easily in the cloud or on premises` because once the Docker Engine installed, it can run any container
image and effectly abstract these environment discrepancies. The ability to stage up new environments easily
and reliably gives us exactly what we need to set up `continuous integration and continuous deployment`.
Ultimately, it means that advanced techniques, such as blue/green deployments, or immutable infrastructure,
become accessible to us, instead of being the privilege of larger organizations able to spend a lot of time
to build their perfect custom tooling.
