# Setup SQL Learning Environment.

[Home](../README.md)

Recently, one of my college ask me a question about SQL query. To be honest, I'm not familiar with SQL (only use simple queries), and hardly uses it in my everyday job. But I think it's a necessary skill, so I plan to learn it. And my goal is that I can use it in a comportable way (No need to Google every queries).

## Learning resources

There are many materials to learn SQL on the Internet. I did some Google and found that we can setup a local database with SQLite and start playing with it without too much effort compare to other kind of database.

The site I choose to start is [sqlitetutorial](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/). This is a very good site to start learning SQL in general, it has a sample database and many exercises for you to play with.

All you have to do is download its sample database, install your favorite SQL client tool and start writing SQL queries. In my case, I choose to install a [SQLite plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite) for VS Code and start learning.

If you want to create your database or runs SQLite shell, just go to [SQLite offical sites](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), download and install it.
